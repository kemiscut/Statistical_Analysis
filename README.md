Capstone project for Statistical Analysis in the Meta Marketing Analysis Specialization 

## About the Dataset 
The capstone dataset spreadsheet is a collection of data comparing the performance of two separate ad campaigns: Facebook Ad campaign and an AdWord Ad campaign. The data is collected for everydayof the year 2019.

## Main Purpose of Analysis 
This is to determine whether one of these ad campaigns is more effective, in terms of conversions, compared to the other.

## Getting to know the data
To better understand how effective the campaigns are at producing conversions, I analyzed the relationship between a campaign's number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions by calculating:
1. The measures of central tendency 
2. Measures of dispersion 
3. Frequency and correlation data for a campaign's clicks and conversions.

## Understanding Data Samples 

To determine whether the data for "Clicks" and "Conversions" falls under a normal distribution curve, I used Excel spreadsheet to create two histograms:
- one for the Clicks
- one for the Conversions


And also determined the variable types I'm working with.

## Testing My Hypothesis 
I formulated a hypothesis to answer the evaluation question:


"Is there a difference between the number of conversions on the Facebook platform versus the AdWords platform?"

I calculated the mean values for the Facebook Ad Conversions and AdWords Conversions data.

Next, I determined whether this overall difference is a statistically significant difference 

Next, with the p-value got,I determined whether to accept or reject the **null hypothesis** or the **alternative hypothesis**.


## Choosing A Model 
I decided to use a Simple Linear Regression model based on purpose and variable requirements and also checked that the variables meet the **normality assumption**.
